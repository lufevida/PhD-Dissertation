The purpose of the present study is the application of self-derivation matrices to the algorithmic composition of acoustic and electroacoustic music. It departs from the seminal works of Daniel Starr and David Kowalski in the field of twelve-tone theory, generalizing the procedure to arbitrary equal-temperament systems. An entirely new algorithm that computes combination matrices of self-derivation for arbitrary row and problem sizes is introduced, representing a major contribution to the fields of music composition and music theory. This algorithm is based on a proposed model for understanding self-derivation from the standpoint of semi-magic squares. A few musical compositions are specially devised with the intent of illustrating the real-life use of the algorithm, and to provide criticism as to where such compositional practices reside within the realm of 21\textsuperscript{st}-century music composition.
