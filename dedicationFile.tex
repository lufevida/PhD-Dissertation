This is the dedication tex file, which should have been set in the main file using the command \verb|\setDedicationFile{Drive:/file/location/dedicationFile}|. Keep in mind this should be written in first person; eg ``I dedicate this to all those people that let me crawl into a cave and disappear while I learned way too much about way too specific of a subject in order to make a meaningful contribution to my field."
